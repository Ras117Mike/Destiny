Please excuse the mess. If you are new to Destiny 2 and want to know how to play the story mode, click here to see the order in which to play so you follow along chronologically. The Basics Destiny 2 is an online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. Like in Destiny 1, activities are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. The game features normal story missions, three-player \"strikes\" and six-player raids, free roam patrol mode for each planet, public events and more seasonal activities. Overview and Introduction Players assume the role of a Guardian [ protectors of Earth's last safe city ] that wields a power called the Light to protect humanity from different alien races. Destiny 2 features the same three character classes as the original Destiny. Each class has their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and three sub-classes that allow players to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. The three classes are Warlock, Hunter, and Titan and three species for their character: Human, Awoken, or Exo. You can have a total of three Characters. Destiny 2 is set one year after the SIVA Crisis that closed off Destiny 1. The story starts off with the Red Legion, let by Dominus Ghaul, launching a massive attack on the Last City, destroying the Tower and attaching a device on the Traveler that starts draining the Light, thereby taking it away from Guardians and their Ghosts leaving Guardians and humanity at the mercy of the Cabal. You follow a vision to a shard of the Traveler where your Ghost interfaces with it and both Ghost's and your light are restored. After reuniting Zavala, Cayde, Ikora and other Guardians;you bring down The Amighty, a solar system destroying ship that the Cabal has pointed at the Sun as an \"Insurance Policy\"; the Cabal either conquer a system or destory it completely. Gaul consumes so much light that he turns into what seems to be a giant light Cabal, it is at this point that the Traveler awakens and destorys Gaul and returns the Light to Guardians all over the system. Following Ghaul's defeat, a massive Cabal ship called the Leviathan appears in orbit of Nessus, under the control of the exiled Emperor Calus. Calus invites Guardians to complete a series of challenges before reaching his throne room. You and a fireteam of other Guardians complete his challenges before facing Calus himself; however, after overcoming his strange powers and defeating him, you discover that you were fighting a mechanical doppelganger. The real Calus speaks through the machine, claiming that what you know is a lie and that there is a truth beyond what the Speaker had told you. Panoptes by Roderick Weise on artstation.com With what seemed like no time at all, Ikora gets word from Osiris that the Vex are busy on Mercury looping through timelines pulling Vex from past and future into a single army to conquer the system. Osiris has been busy studying the Infinite Forest, a Vex construct that Panoptes -a Vex Mind- has been using to s aimulate multiple realities and timelines in hopes of finding one where the Vex wins. Growing concern causes Osiris to send his ghost Sagira to get word to Ikora. You go on several missions to defeat the Vex, culminating in meeting Osiris and destroying Panoptes together. Ana Bray -a Guardian- headed to Mars during the battle of Twilight Gap to investigate her past and her connection to Clovis Bray, the Braytech Company and her past. After defeating Panoptese, you get a distress signal from Mars and we travel to investigate, we meet up with Ana and go through a series of missions to fight back the Cabal and Hive there. During these missions we learn of Oryx's other son Nokris and the Worm God Xol. Together with Ana, you access the Warmind's vault on Mars, yes the very Rasputin we've been hearing about since Destiny 1 and defeat both Nokris and Xol. Warmind by Joseph Biwald on artstation.com And just when you thought you could kick back a bit, word from the Prison of Elders was that there was a breakout and together with Cayde-6 you head the the Reef and meet up with Petra Venj. It is here that you learn that a new race called the Scorned has formed, while trying to bring order to the chaos Cayde-6 is killed with his own gun -Ace of Sades- by Prince Uldren Sov. Uldren is aided by Fikrul and his band of Scorned Barons. You go on a series of missions to avange Cayde-6 since Zavala refuses to fight back in fear of loosing more friends, you meet up with the Spider who helps you along at the Tangled Shore as you find and kill each Baron on your way to Uldren. During the hunt for Uldren, you are taken to The Dreaming City by Petra Venj where you learn that Uldren was swallowed by the Voice of Riven. You kill it and release Uldren and this chapter ends in a cliff hanger not knowing if it was your bullet or Petra's that killed Uldren. You then learn about Riven and set off on a quest to kill it. After defeating Riven, a three week curse cycle is unleashed on the Dreaming City that is yet to be broken. Dreaming City Towers by Ethan Scheu on artstation.com As the Traveler awoken at the end of the Red War, he releases a pulse of light that travels through the Solar System and awakens a fleet of Pyramid ships. After the events of the Dreaming City and defeating Uldren, Voice of Riven and Riven, you get a distress call about a new disturbance on the moon and are called to action by Ikora Rey about a Scarlet Keep, a tower that the Hive built on the Moon. Turns out Eris headed to the Moon and was doing some investigations of her own, here she found one of the Pyramid ships under the surface of the Moon. Pyramid Ships by Dorje Bellbrook on artstation.com As you headed to the Pyramid ship to investigate, you hit a barrier and a red matter unleashes a Nightmare of Crota. You attempt to defeat him again like you did on the moon but he keep regenerating and two more Nightmares appear. Eris teleports you to her and explains to you what is happening. Turns out the Pyramid ships are from the Darkenss and the one on the Moon allows the Hive to literally bring back defeated enemies from your past, hence the name Nightmares. Enter Hashlad\u00fbn, Crota's daughter who built the Scarlet Keep to harness the powers of the Darkness to avenge her father's death. You are sent on a series of missions by Eris to reconstruct a set of armor that will grant you access to the Pyramid ship. After killing several nightmares, you are sent into the Scarlet Keep to acquire a Hive Relic that allows you to unlock special gear. After collecting equipment you make it into the ship where you pass through the corridors and have to defeat Nightmares of Crota, Fikrul and Gaul. The Scarlet Keep by Kyoungche Kim on artstation.com After defeating all three Nightmares, you make it to a room where you are offered an Artifact which causes you to have a vision of the Black Garden where an image of yourself appears to you along with multiple Pyramid Ships and you are told that the are your Salvation. Ikora and Eris think that this is a message from the Darkness that they are planning to attack and bring on another collapse. Undying Mind by Roderick Weise on artstation.com This all shoved aside tho as you get word about the Vex have resurrected the Undying Mind, you enter the Black Garden and destroy several Vex bosses and then travel to several Timelines via a portal that Ikora built at the tower and destroyed the Undying Mind in all the lines. After stopping the Vex invasion and destroying the Undying Mind, you get more word from Osiris on Mercury that the Cabal found his Sundial and are using it to find a timeline where the Red Legion wins the Red War so they can change the timeline to suit them. It is where you currently find yourself fighting along side Legendary Guardian Saint-14 after you travel through time to resurrect him. Your story goes on Guardian...

Find Osiris on Mercury. Recovery Operation - The structure of the obelisk must be repaired so it can be linked to the Sundial. Osiris believes some members of the Red Legion fled Mercury with tech pilfered from the Sundial. If you recover the components, you may be able to forge a link. Defeat Cabal on the Tangled Shore to recover Sundial Components. Cabal defeated with Solar weapons and abilities may drop additional materials. Reinforcements - You've recovered the materials that will help connect the obelisk to the Sundial. Now, you must bring these back to the obelisk in order to modify it. Bank the recovered Sundial Components at the obelisk. Light Collection - Now that you've modified the obelisk with tech from the Sundial, there is only one more component needed: your Light. The obelisk is not yet active, but using your Light to charge it will allow you to bring it back to full power. Charge the obelisk by defeating enemies with abilities and your Super, and by collecting Orbs of Light. Light Infusion - You have gathered a powerful Light charge, which you can transfer to the obelisk. Once you charge the obelisk with this Light, you will restore it to its full power. Bank the Light charge you accumulated to power the obelisk. Timeline Stabilization - You've restored the obelisk and charged it with your Light. You must finalize its activation to attune it to the temporal disturbance stemming from Mercury. Interact with the obelisk to complete its activation. A Missing Link - The obelisk is fully functioning. All that's left is to link it to the Sundial by strengthening its power here on the Shore. Activate the Tangled Shore Obelisk's Sundial link. Visit Osiris - Now that the link between the obelisk and the Sundial is established, Osiris needs your help within the Sundial itself. Return to Osiris at the Sundial Spire on Mercury. The Sundial - Osiris has asked you to enter the Sundial so that he might calibrate it to you, allowing you to move across Mercury's past and future to defeat the Cabal. Enter the Sundial Arena playlist. Detached from Time - As you left the Sundial, you found a strange object that seemed to materialize from nowhere. The object is unidentifiable, but seems to be phasing between timelines, flickering in your hands. You think Osiris may be able to help you determine its origin. Bring the phased object to Osiris at the Sundial Spire.","title":"Story Line"},{"location":"story_line/#the-red-war","text":"Homecoming - The Last City is under attack by the Red Legion.

A Disturbance on Mercury - Ikora believes Osiris will be able to explain the Red Legion's renewed interest in Mercury, but she can't contact him. She's sending you in her stead. Find Osiris on Mercury. Recovery Operation - The structure of the obelisk must be repaired so it can be linked to the Sundial. Osiris believes some members of the Red Legion fled Mercury with tech pilfered from the Sundial. If you recover the components, you may be able to forge a link. Defeat Cabal on the Tangled Shore to recover Sundial Components. Cabal defeated with Solar weapons and abilities may drop additional materials. Reinforcements - You've recovered the materials that will help connect the obelisk to the Sundial. Now, you must bring these back to the obelisk in order to modify it. Bank the recovered Sundial Components at the obelisk. Light Collection - Now that you've modified the obelisk with tech from the Sundial, there is only one more component needed: your Light. The obelisk is not yet active, but using your Light to charge it will allow you to bring it back to full power. Charge the obelisk by defeating enemies with abilities and your Super, and by collecting Orbs of Light. Light Infusion - You have gathered a powerful Light charge, which you can transfer to the obelisk. Once you charge the obelisk with this Light, you will restore it to its full power. Bank the Light charge you accumulated to power the obelisk. Timeline Stabilization - You've restored the obelisk and charged it with your Light. You must finalize its activation to attune it to the temporal disturbance stemming from Mercury. Interact with the obelisk to complete its activation. A Missing Link - The obelisk is fully functioning. All that's left is to link it to the Sundial by strengthening its power here on the Shore. Activate the Tangled Shore Obelisk's Sundial link. Visit Osiris - Now that the link between the obelisk and the Sundial is established, Osiris needs your help within the Sundial itself. Return to Osiris at the Sundial Spire on Mercury. The Sundial - Osiris has asked you to enter the Sundial so that he might calibrate it to you, allowing you to move across Mercury's past and future to defeat the Cabal. Enter the Sundial Arena playlist. Detached from Time - As you left the Sundial, you found a strange object that seemed to materialize from nowhere. The object is unidentifiable, but seems to be phasing between timelines, flickering in your hands. You think Osiris may be able to help you determine its origin. Bring the phased object to Osiris at the Sundial Spire.","title":"Season of Dawn"},{"location":"the_cabal/","text":"The Cabal Structure Quote \"In the Cabal legend, a hero seeks to possess the sun.

Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\". GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright \u00a9 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.","title":"License"},{"location":"about/license/#license","text":"Copyright (C) 2019-2020 Ras117Mike.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.","title":"0. PREAMBLE"},{"location":"about/license/#1-applicability-and-definitions","text":"This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.","title":"1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS"},{"location":"about/license/#2-verbatim-copying","text":"You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.","title":"2. VERBATIM COPYING"},{"location":"about/license/#3-copying-in-quantity","text":"If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.","title":"3. COPYING IN QUANTITY"},{"location":"about/license/#4-modifications","text":"You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.","title":"4. MODIFICATIONS"},{"location":"about/license/#5-combining-documents","text":"You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".","title":"5.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.","title":"6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS"},{"location":"about/license/#7-aggregation-with-independent-works","text":"A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.","title":"7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS"},{"location":"about/license/#8-translation","text":"Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.","title":"8.

Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.","title":"9.

She repairs Guardians' personal spaceships, as well as sells new ships and Sparrows. Amanda is also involved in organizing the Sparrow Racing League and works closely with the SRL pilots to upgrade their Sparrows and experiment with new designs. Amanda was born on the road to a refugee family traveling towards the Last City. Her people were scavengers, and her childhood was spent fixing up vehicles that helped her family survive. Her mother Nora carried a weapon named The Chaperone, a finely decorated shotgun that she used to protect the refugee group. While traveling with another family who had a young daughter named Lucia, the band was forced to take shelter in a crashed dropship in a forest due to bad weather. Amanda was shown by Lucia how to work with the electronic components they scavenged form the dropship which they used to create small lights all around the ship. Amanda's mother died while defending her family on the road as they were crossing the Panama Ravine. She and her father buried Nora with the Chaperone before carrying on their journey towards the Last City. Sadly, when they were only a half-day's walk away from the gates of the City, Amanda's father also perished, leaving her the only survivor of her family and refugee group to reach the last safe haven for humanity under the Traveler. Amanda was critical in the Taken war as she outfitted Eris Morn's ship with stealth technology, at the behest of Cayde-6 for his plan to use in for an unsanctioned mission to board the Dreadnaught. Amanda worked with Tex Mechanica to recreate her mother's shotgun, the Chaperone, and award a copy of it to the winner of a Crucible contest. She created an exact replica of the weapon her mother used, down to it tracery, although it was far more powerful due to Tex Mechanica's engineering. She also helped bring the Sparrow Racing League to the mainstream, acting as host for the races, and assisting Guardians in obtaining Licenses Amanda is typically very jovial and sarcastic. She gets along well with Cayde-6, as both are willing to bend or break the Vanguard's rules to get tasks done. While on Titan, Amanda's personality seems to undergo a slight change as she appears somewhat subdued and even reluctant to take part in missions. This may be due to shock at having lost the City, and having seen so many Lightless Guardians fall. She recovers following the reclamation of the Last City from the Red Legion.

Amanda's mother died while defending her family on the road as they were crossing the Panama Ravine. She and her father buried Nora with the Chaperone before carrying on their journey towards the Last City. Sadly, when they were only a half-day's walk away from the gates of the City, Amanda's father also perished, leaving her the only survivor of her family and refugee group to reach the last safe haven for humanity under the Traveler. Amanda was critical in the Taken war as she outfitted Eris Morn's ship with stealth technology, at the behest of Cayde-6 for his plan to use in for an unsanctioned mission to board the Dreadnaught. Amanda worked with Tex Mechanica to recreate her mother's shotgun, the Chaperone, and award a copy of it to the winner of a Crucible contest. She created an exact replica of the weapon her mother used, down to it tracery, although it was far more powerful due to Tex Mechanica's engineering. She also helped bring the Sparrow Racing League to the mainstream, acting as host for the races, and assisting Guardians in obtaining Licenses Amanda is typically very jovial and sarcastic. She gets along well with Cayde-6, as both are willing to bend or break the Vanguard's rules to get tasks done. While on Titan, Amanda's personality seems to undergo a slight change as she appears somewhat subdued and even reluctant to take part in missions. This may be due to shock at having lost the City, and having seen so many Lightless Guardians fall. She recovers following the reclamation of the Last City from the Red Legion.","title":"Personnel Data"},{"location":"amanda_holliday/personel_data/#location","text":"","title":"Location"},{"location":"amanda_holliday/personel_data/#sources","text":"Destinypedia lowlidev","title":"Sources"},{"location":"ana_bray/bounties/","text":"Ana Bray Bounties Name Description Type Count Rewards GIVE 'EM HELLAS Defeat enemies on Mars. \"The Hive regard Rasputin as a threat.

To get this, visit Werner-44 on the Barge on Nessus and open the chest next to him, it will cost you 5000 glimmer however. Spawn to the Watcher's Grave area and the barge will be directly in front of you. p.s. the Xur (IX) logo will not always be on the map as he moves around the world but that is the location of the barge. Invitation from the Emperor After you open the chest, you will get the Invitation from the Emperor step. To complete this step you will need to visit the Tribute Hall and speak to the Visage of Calus. To get to the Tribute Hall, bring up Nessus from the Destinations map and at the bottom you will see the icon next to the Leviathan and Menagerie icons. Once inside, interact with the Visage and acquire, complete and turn in a daily bounty which grants you a Boon of Opulence and unlocks the Hall. Return to the Hall Complete Champion Bounties and Unlock Tributes To progress the quest you will need to complete bounties and unlock statues. Bounties will grant you Boon of Opulence which will reduce the cost of items in the hall by 1% up to a total of 80%. Tributes grant you statutes that you use to place around the hall to unlock different features of the hall, they range from Orbs of Light, to Ammo to Holograms of enemies to target practice with. Tributes You will need to complete 18 Tributes to unlock the Bad Juju Quest itself. To gain Tributes you can buy tributes from the Visage. These cost lots of materials so getting those Boons will be important for this process. Spider rotates materials for sale so check him out if you are in need. The other way is to complete Triumphs but you will need to have Calus themed gear and weapons to progress these. Items with a Chalice logo in the icon will work (Season of Opulence rewards you get from Menagerie). The more pieces you have on the better, exotics are even better for progress. To check what you need to complete, open the Triumphs tab on your menu and click the Destination Tab.

Force-feed the murmuring shadows until they are fit to burst with illumination. Once you've completed the Shadowkeep Campaign you will get a quest from Eris named Luna's Calling which will depend on a weekly memory bounties which you can pick up from Eris after completing the previous one. Memory of Sai Mota This step reads: Complete the \u201cLunar Spelunker\u201d bounty to earn a Firewall Data Fragment. Use the fragment to access the system core vault in the K1 Revelation Lost Sector. Purchase Eris Morn\u2019s weekly bounty, Lunar Spelunker. Lunar Spelunking For this step you will need to complete 3 Lost Sectors on the moon as follows: K1 Communion in the Anchor of Light K1 Crew Quarters in the Hellmouth K1 Logistics in Archer's Line Complete all three Sectors, ensure you actually open the chest or it will not count as completed. Turning in this bounty will grant you a Firewall Data Fragment and the next step in the Memory of Sai Mota Quest. Memory of Sai Mota System core vault accessed You will now need to complete the K1 Revelation Lost Sector in Sorrows Harbor . Run through and kill everything in your way . Once you kill the boss and open the chest, with your back toward the way you made it to the boss area, turn to the right and you will see a tunnel with gold lighting. Head in that tunnel, open the door and interact with the terminal. There will be a Jade Rabbit in the back of the room with the terminal in case you have a cake. Once you interact with the terminal you will get two new bounties: Cleansed Essence of Jealousy Memory of Sai Mota Sai Mota\u2019s Broken Necklace This step reads: Search for scraps of Sai Mota\u2019s necklace by defeating Nightmares on the Moon with Arc abilities. Stronger enemies grant more progress. Sorrow\u2019s Harbor is the best location to do this as there are always Nightmares spawning there, or you can hit Lost Sectors and Nightmare Hunts. Sai Mota\u2019s Repaired Necklace Use the portal in Sanctuary to return Sai Mota\u2019s Repaired Necklace to Eris. Once you've completed gathering fragments, head to Sanctuary and enter the taken portal, present her with the Necklace to claim your prize from the chest next to Eris and get some bits of lore, select \"Hear More\" to get more lore. Symphony of Death This step reads: This quest is the reward you get from the chest, it will kick off with the next step. Faculties of the Skull This step reads: Eris Morn believes the Hive\u2019s wicked science can be turned against them. Help her investigate the Circle of Bones beneath the Moon. Make your way to Circle of Bones in the Hellmouth, locate the Blue banner to launch the next step. Head into the Summoning Pits and stop the Hive\u2019s Wicked Communion. This will drop launch the next step, Tainted Lullaby. Tainted Lullaby This step reads: Your understanding of the Hive\u2019s Deathsong has only just begun. Take the Silent Skull to Eris Morn. Head to Sanctuary and speak with Eris, she will give you the next step. Marrow\u2019s Elegy This step reads: Collect bones from public events near the Hellmouth, the Lost Sector K1 Revelation in Sorrow\u2019s Harbor, and a wandering Bone Collector on the Moon. This step instructs you to Collect bones from public events near the Hellmouth, the Lost Sector K1 Revelation in Sorrow\u2019s Harbor, and a wandering Bone Collector on the Moon.

Spawn in the Sanctuary and head to Anchor of Light, as you enter the area, hang a left, the Bone Collector usually spawns in this area a lot. Kill it and get your bone. Thy Honored Conductor This step reads: Enter the Scarlet Keep strike and slay the High Conductor, Sulmakta, within. You will need to launch the Scarlet Keep strike on the moon and kill the High Conductor, Sulmakta before you kill the boss. I have heard of some people experiencing issues with her spawning, she should be in the same room as the boss when she does. Of Darkest Harmony This step reads: Record your enemies\u2019 screams.

This guide will walk you through these initial steps. Lunar Battlegrounds. (Initiate the Quest) This is the area you first spawn into right after you launch Shadowkeep. To get back there, spawn on the moon at the Sorrow Harbor\u2019s location. From the spawn point, go straight ahead and you\u2019ll find a bridge, go across it and proceed until you get to the Battlegrounds area, as you enter make a left turn before actually getting to the buildings, there will be a cave that you go into. In the cave will be a giant Vex gate which is the entrance to the raid. Approach the gate and Vex will start attacking you, keep killing them until a Gate Lord shows up, kill him and he will drop an Exotic Engram which will start the quest for you. Lost Sectors on Nessus (Vex Core analyzed) For this step you will need to visit three lost sectors (you don\u2019t need to kill the boss): The Orrey in Artifact\u2019s Edge Once in the Orrey, proceed to the first path where you encounter Vex, on the left wall as you are looking at the Boss will be a small hole that you will need to enter into.

Ancient\u2019s Haunt in The Tangle After you first encounter the Vex, continue into the cave, on the left wall there will be a smaller cave, do the same as above to activate the Oracle. The Conflux in The Cistern. Once in the lost sector, continue until you get to the room where the boss is in, before proceeding to the boss, on the right wall there will be an opening which will lead you to an Oracle where you will proceed as in the Orrey. To get to the hole you will need to jump up the middle column and turn to the right as you face the boss. Kill vex on the moon (Decryption Core repaired) Once you have completed the above, the next step will take you to the moon where you have to kill vex to collect 120 Decryption Cores, the easiest way to get through this is in the Vex Offensive. Lectern Of Enchantment (Core empowered) Once you have collected the Decryption Cores, head to the Lectern Of Enchantment and charge the item you got from the last step with Phantasmal Fragments. You will need 30 of them. If you don\u2019t have enough, you can farm them in Sorrow Harbor\u2019s or buy them with Helium Filaments. The Garden Of Salvation Raid (Complete the quest) You will now need to go into the Raid to complete the puzzles in it, you need to complete all of them in one sitting and the last one is at the end of the raid so basically, you need to complete the raid in one go. I won\u2019t go into these steps as I don\u2019t want to ruin the raid experience for anyone that would want to explore it for themselves with no help. If you want to do this the easy way, I\u2019d say check out KackisHD\u2019s full Raid Guide .","title":"Divinity"},{"location":"exotics/weapons/divinity_exotic/#divinity-exotic-trace-rifle-guide","text":"Text Image Calibrate reality.

Intro to Safecracking 101 \u201cYou need a rotating keycode to access the Bow in Banshee\u2019s workshop, but the original has been lost. You\u2019ll have to generate a new code following the same steps that Banshee did. First on Banshee\u2019s list is to get out into the field to seed a key generator with combat data. Seed data for a new keycode by completing Gambit matches or Vanguard strikes. Gambit Prime matches and Nightfall strikes grant the most efficient progress.\u201d For this step I did 2 Nightfalls. Advanced Safecracking 201 \u201cThe key generator is seeded with viable combat data, and it can now output keycodes\u2026 but to constrain the possible set of generated codes, Ghost says you\u2019ll need to provide the generator with some more targeted data. Literally. Use a Bow to land precision final blows against Vex or Cabal.\u201d This step requires you to get headshots with a box on Cabal or Vex. I completed this step quickly on the Leviathan. Load up the Raid up and head to the Castellum, Cabal come in waves once you've found the point that the Standards will be taken to, simply walk on the plate to start the process. Economics of War \u201cThe key generator needs just a little more data before you\u2019re ready to return to Banshee for final authentication. To further limit the possible codes the generator can create, you\u2019ll have to recreate the conditions under which Banshee programmed the first codes: fighting Red Legion forces during the Red War. Complete an epic reprise of strike \u201cThe Arms Dealer\u201d in the European Dead Zone on Earth.\u201d At this point you need to complete a modified version of The Arms Dealer Strike on the EDZ. You will only have to do the Boss section. Here a few things to note for this step: * Don't stand in the same place for too long as there are bombs that fall from the sky and will kill you. Red markers will show to warn you. * Keep an eye for Zahn's sniper, it melts rather hard. * Ensure you are killing enemies as they can get overwhelming. The machanics remain similar as the normal strike. Get Zahn's health down and toward the end of each bar, he will spawn his bubble sheild and call for backup. Pickup the orb and take it to the vent to move forward. Rinse and repeat until you complete the strike. Complete the quest That's it, you are done with actual work.

Text Image I knew it. Knew I'd be back one day\u2014only this time, I was something else. Something\u2026 not Human. Not by choice, of course. Those damn Hive. They weren't just tryin' to kill me. They were using me to get to my Light. To drain it from my soul. For their sick experiments. \u2014Omar Agah Full Lore on Ishtar Collective Emergence Icon Description Around you\u2026 darkness. If you are to discover your path, you must anchor yourself to light. \"It was hard to see the point of a single fireteam taking on Crota, but it was easy to understand how retribution had driven us there. The names of everyone we'd lost in that needless disaster were etched across the walls of the Last City, each and every one a reminder that they were gone and we were not. So when Eriana-3 came knocking, it was a simple decision. From top to bottom, we'd avenge every one of those names. A fire burned in all six of us. We were gonna make sure Crota knew it.\" \u2014A loyal friend Emerged from the dark: 1 To start this quest off you will need to head to the Enduring Abyss, it's the place where you meet Eris after you've finished a memory Pursuit. Sometimes there may be a portal at the Moon spawn point if someone has a quest step to head to Eris at the Abyss. You can also get to it as follows: Spawn into Sorrow's Harbour Head into the Scarlet Keep and follow the path you did when you first got to fight Crota At the first lamp, look to the Right, there is a pathway on the cave wall that will take you to the place you meet Eris but she will not be there With your back toward the Pyramid ship, interact with the statues as follows: Bottom Left Top Left Bottom Right Top Right The second part of this step involves lighting Lecterns in Anchor of Light on the Moon. Head over to anchor of light and proceed to get the light then light the Lecterns and emerge from the Dark. Pathfinder Icon Description A light shines on your path. But you have yet to bring it into focus. Until then, your path remains among the lost. \"For me, there was no return from Crota. I lacked hope. Made me not the easiest to get along with. I knew that. But it didn't matter to Eris. She saw hope in me where I wouldn't. Wanted to say thanks, so I tried to gift her a trinket, but she rejected it. Eris wasn't looking for gratitude; she truly saw hope in us all. On our own, we were nothing. But as she'd always remind us, lost as we might be, true strength came from our union. Eris's words rang in my ears as the Hive tore my Light from my soul.\" \u2014A loyal friend Archer's Line Path Fragment found: 1 Sorrow's Harbor Path Fragment found: 1 Hellmouth Path Fragment found: 1 Anchor of Light Path Fragment found: 1 To complete this step, you will need to complete each lost sector on the Moon and locate the Hive Rune Puzzles and solve them as follows: K1 Communion (Anchor of Light) Bottom Left Bottom Right Middle Top Middle Top K1 Logistics (Archer's Line) Middle Left Bottom Left Middle Right Middle K1 Crew Quarters (Hellmouth) Top Right Middle Left Middle Middle Bottom Middle Right Middle Right Middle Bottom Middle Bottom K1 Revelation (Sorrow's Harbour) Middle Right Middle Left Middle Middle Middle Left Middle Top Middle Bottom Middle For the rest of the quest, you will need to have unlocked the Pit of Heresy . Descent Icon Description Your path brightens, shining through the barrier of emerald, beneath a harbor built from sorrow. \"The worst part about what the Hive did to us wasn't the killing. It was the separation. Splitting us up made us weak. They dragged me deep below the lunar surface, through a wall of endless doors. Strung me up. Made my Ghost, Karsys, watch as they tore my Light away, like stripping muscle from bone. Then they killed Karsys in front of me. Sure would've been nice then to have had some of that hope Eris had been peddling.\" \u2014A loyal friend Path uncovered: 1 To complete this step you will need to complete the first phase of the Pit of Heresy dungeon. This involves killing three bosses. To complete this phase you can follow our guide here After you finish the Necropolis make your way down, when you get to the big crimson wall with lots of doors, look up and to the left; the door you will need to go in will be to third second door to the left with no marking on it. Make your way to the door then enter the room, there will be a scannable item in the back left that you will need to pick up to be able to finish the next step. Discovery Icon Description The Pariahs stand guard over far more than just despair, for within these tunnels lie many secrets. \"I did see one familiar face before the end. I'm not sure how she found me\u2014probably followed the Hive's trail of runes or something. \"The resilience of Eris Morn\u2014her greatest strength and her greatest weakness. To see the Heart of Crota peel my Light away and feed it to those disgusting little maggots and yet do nothing to stop it\u2026 She made the right call. 'Else the fire in us both might've gone out that day. I'd never blame her.\" \u2014A loyal friend Path's end located: 1 To complete this step you will need to complete the second phase of the Pit of Heresy dungeon. This involves finding the hidden fire and lighting the door way to open the path to Volm\u00e2r. To complete this phase you can follow our guide here Slay Volm\u00e2r, the Tempted Icon Description The end of your path is in sight. Defeat those who would keep you from it. \"Eris did something truly kind for me, however, in those final moments. When she found me strung up, I saw her clutching the trinket I had made her\u2014the one she'd rejected\u2014tightly against her chest. I never forgot that. She'd made sure in that moment that the fire in my heart didn't go out. Made sure I knew I wasn't alone. The fire in me raged. What I would've given to stand with my fireteam one last time and burn those heathens to oblivion!\" \u2014A loyal friend Volm\u00e2r, the Tempted slain: 1 This section is a bit tricky and there are some interesting mechanics involved. Each person in the fireteam will get one of the following elemental buffs: Fiery Finality Icon Description Return to Eris Morn with the Hive bug. \"As they peeled away my Light piece by piece, the dark began to set in. I went limp. My mind started to fade. But the fire raged on. \"It's a funny thing, dying for good twice. I imagine my first death was frightening. But this one was calming. This time I knew I wasn't really gone forever. Neither were my friends. Vell. Eriana. Sai. Toland. \u2026Eris. There was peace in that. Knowing we'd always be together, somewhere. Somehow. \"I felt my spirit leave my body through my Light. And then\u2014only darkness.\" \u2014A loyal friend Eris Morn visited: 1 Visit Eris Morn, she will give you the Xenophage.","title":"Xenophage"},{"location":"exotics/weapons/xenophage_exotic/#xenophage-exotic-quest","text":"This might sting a little.

So when Eriana-3 came knocking, it was a simple decision. From top to bottom, we'd avenge every one of those names. A fire burned in all six of us.

Eris wasn't looking for gratitude; she truly saw hope in us all. On our own, we were nothing. But as she'd always remind us, lost as we might be, true strength came from our union.
