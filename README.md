# Destiny 2

Destiny 2 is an online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. Like in Destiny 1, activities are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. The game features normal story missions, three-player "strikes" and six-player raids, free roam patrol mode for each planet, public events and more seasonal activities.


## Why Do this?
I got tired of going back and forth between different site and resources to get bit of information to make up a whole and kept it in a text editor on my computer and I thought that if I find notes useful, others probably do as well; so I created this project as a personal store for the information I lookup so that I don't have to keep going all over the place again and again and for others to be able to use the notes I've taken.
