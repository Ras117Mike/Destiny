## Personnel Data

Anatasia Bray is an adopted member of House of Bray, the founders of the exoscience corporation Clovis Bray and a contributor to the development of Rasputin, she was resurrected as a Hunter and is famous for her role at Twilight Gap.

During the Golden Age, Ana worked at Clovis Bray with her adopted family. Calling herself a “psycholinguist”, Ana’s job was to teach Rasputin how to think like a human instead of respond like a machine.  

She appears in the Destiny 2 Warmind expansion as she attempts to uncover the mystery behind Rasputin and the polar ice caps of Mars.

Free-spirited and adventurous with a sarcastic sense of humor, Ana Bray is determined to seek the answers regarding her past and of her connection to the Warmind, Rasputin.

Throughout the conflict with the Grasp of Nokris Hive faction and the Worm God Xol, Ana Bray continuously believed that the Last City needs Rasputin and his cooperation. As a result, she constantly brought her case of gaining the Warmind's support to a reluctant Zavala who believes that Rasputin will not heed to the priorities of the Vanguard or the safety of humanity. Though Ana proved that Rasputin listens to her, even she can't discern Rasputin's motives with complete clarity.

With the Shadowkeep DLC you will need to proceed through the initial quest steps to unlock different planets to get to Mars and Ana.
