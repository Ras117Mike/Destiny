## Information and Guides for the Destiny Games

## The Basics
Destiny 2 is an online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. Like in Destiny 1, activities are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. The game features normal story missions, three-player "strikes" and six-player raids, free roam patrol mode for each planet, public events and more seasonal activities.

## Overview and Introduction
Players assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city that wield a power called the Light to protect humanity from different alien races. Destiny 2 features the same three character classes as the original Destiny. Each class has their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and three sub-classes that allow players to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. The three classes are Warlock, Hunter, and Titan and three species for their character: Human, Awoken, or Exo. You can have a total of three Characters.<img align="right" src="https://ras117mike.github.io/Destiny2/images/general/dominus_ghaul.png" height="300">

Destiny 2 is set one year after the SIVA Crisis that closed off Destiny 1. The story starts off with the Red Legion, let by Dominus Ghaul, launching a massive attack on the Last City, destroying the Tower and attaching a device on the Traveler that starts draining the Light, thereby taking it away from Guardians  and their Ghosts leaving Guardians and humanity at the mercy of the Cabal. You follow a vision to a shard of the Traveler where your Ghost interfaces with it and both Ghost's and your light are restored. After reuniting Zavala, Cayde, Ikora and other Guardians;you bring down The Amighty, a solar system destroying ship that the Cabal has pointed at the Sun as an "Insurance Policy"; the Cabal either conquer a system or destory it completely.

Gaul consumes so much light that he turns into what seems to be a giant light Cabal, it is at this point that the Traveler awakens and destorys Gaul and returns the Light to Guardians all over the system.

Following Ghaul's defeat, a massive Cabal ship called the Leviathan appears in orbit of Nessus, under the control of the exiled Emperor Calus. Calus invites Guardians to complete a series of challenges before reaching his throne room. You and a fireteam of other Guardians complete his challenges before facing Calus himself; however, after overcoming his strange powers and defeating him, you discover that you were fighting a mechanical doppelganger. The real Calus speaks through the machine, claiming that what you know is a lie and that there is a truth beyond what the Speaker had told you.

</figure>

With what seemed like no time at all, Ikora gets word from Osiris that the Vex are busy on Mercury looping through timelines pulling Vex from past and future into a single army to conquer the system. Osiris has been busy studying the Infinite Forest, a Vex construct that Panoptes -a Vex Mind- has been using to s aimulate multiple realities and timelines in hopes of finding one where the Vex wins. Growing concern causes Osiris to send his ghost Sagira to get word to Ikora. You go on several missions to defeat the Vex, culminating in meeting Osiris and destroying Panoptes together.

Ana Bray -a Guardian- headed to Mars during the battle of Twilight Gap to investigate her past and her connection to Clovis Bray, the Braytech Company and her past. After defeating Panoptese, you get a distress signal from Mars and we travel to investigate, we meet up with Ana and go through a series of missions to fight back the Cabal and Hive there. During these missions we learn of Oryx's other son Nokris and the Worm God Xol. Together with Ana, you access the Warmind's vault on Mars, yes the very Rasputin we've been hearing about since Destiny 1 and defeat both Nokris and Xol.

And just when you thought you could kick back a bit, word from the Prison of Elders was that there was a breakout and together with Cayde-6 you head the the Reef and meet up with Petra Venj. It is here that you learn that a new race called the Scorned has formed, while trying to bring order to the chaos Cayde-6 is killed with his own gun -Ace of Sades- by Prince Uldren Sov. Uldren is aided by Fikrul and his band of Scorned Barons.

You go on a series of missions to avange Cayde-6 since Zavala refuses to fight back in fear of loosing more friends, you meet up with the Spider who helps you along at the Tangled Shore as you find and kill each Baron on your way to Uldren. During the hunt for Uldren, you are taken to The Dreaming City by Petra Venj where you learn that Uldren was swallowed by the Voice of Riven. You kill it and release Uldren and this chapter ends in a cliff hanger not knowing if it was your bullet or Petra's that killed Uldren.

You then learn about Riven and set off on a quest to kill it. After defeating Riven, a three week curse cycle is unleashed on the Dreaming City that is yet to be broken.

As the Traveler awoken at the end of the Red War, he releases a pulse of light that travels through the Solar System and awakens a fleet of Pyramid ships. After the events of the Dreaming City and defeating Uldren, Voice of Riven and Riven, you get a distress call about a new disturbance on the moon and are called to action by Ikora Rey about a Scarlet Keep, a tower that the Hive built on the Moon. Turns out Eris headed to the Moon and was doing some investigations of her own, here she found one of the Pyramid ships under the surface of the Moon.

  <figcaption>Pyramid Ships by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/dorje">Dorje Bellbrook</a> on artstation.com</figcaption>
</figure>

As you headed to the Pyramid ship to investigate, you hit a barrier and a red matter unleashes a Nightmare of Crota.  You attempt to defeat him again like you did on the moon but he keep regenerating and two more Nightmares appear. Eris teleports you to her and explains to you what is happening. Turns out the Pyramid ships are from the Darkenss and the one on the Moon allows the Hive to literally bring back defeated enemies from your past, hence the name Nightmares.

Enter Hashlad√ªn, Crota's daughter who built the Scarlet Keep to harness the powers of the Darkness to avenge her father's death. You are sent on a series of missions by Eris to reconstruct a set of armor that will grant you access to the Pyramid ship. After killing several nightmares, you are sent into the Scarlet Keep to acquire a Hive Relic that allows you to unlock special gear. After collecting equipment you make it into the ship where you pass through the corridors and have to defeat Nightmares of Crota, Fikrul and Gaul.

  <figcaption>The Scarlet Keep by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/entheosche">Kyoungche Kim</a> on artstation.com</figcaption>
</figure>

After defeating all three Nightmares, you make it to a room where you are offered an Artifact which causes you to have a vision of the Black Garden where an image of yourself appears to you along with multiple Pyramid Ships and you are told that the are your Salvation. Ikora and Eris think that this is a message from the Darkness that they are planning to attack and bring on another collapse.

  <figcaption>Undying Mind by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/roderickweise">Roderick Weise</a> on artstation.com</figcaption>
</figure>

This all shoved aside tho as you get word about the Vex have resurrected the Undying Mind, you enter the Black Garden and destroy several Vex bosses and then travel to several Timelines via a portal that Ikora built at the tower and destroyed the Undying Mind in all the lines.

After stopping the Vex invasion and destroying the Undying Mind, you get more word from Osiris on Mercury that the Cabal found his Sundial and are using it to find a timeline where the Red Legion wins the Red War so they can change the timeline to suit them. It is where you currently find yourself fighting along side Legendary Guardian Saint-14 after you travel through time to resurrect him.
