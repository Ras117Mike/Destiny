The Divinity is something you get from the raid but there are some steps you will need to do before you go into the raid itself. This guide will walk you through these initial steps.

## Lunar Battlegrounds. (Initiate the Quest)

This is the area you first spawn into right after you launch Shadowkeep. To get back there, spawn on the moon at the Sorrow Harbor’s location. From the spawn point, go straight ahead and you’ll find a bridge, go across it and proceed until you get to the Battlegrounds area, as you enter make a left turn before actually getting to the buildings, there will be a cave that you go into. In the cave will be a giant Vex gate which is the entrance to the raid.

Approach the gate and Vex will start attacking you, keep killing them until a Gate Lord shows up, kill him and he will drop an Exotic Engram which will start the quest for you.

## Lost Sectors on Nessus (Vex Core analyzed)

For this step you will need to visit three lost sectors (you don’t need to kill the boss):

### The Orrey in Artifact’s Edge

Once in the Orrey, proceed to the first path where you encounter Vex, on the left wall as you are looking at the Boss will be a small hole that you will need to enter into. In the room will be an Oracle that you need to activate. Once activated, some Vex will spawn in, kill them all and then activate the Oracle again.

### Ancient’s Haunt in The Tangle

After you first encounter the Vex, continue into the cave, on the left wall there will be a smaller cave, do the same as above to activate the Oracle.

### The Conflux in The Cistern.

Once in the lost sector, continue until you get to the room where the boss is in, before proceeding to the boss, on the right wall there will be an opening which will lead you to an Oracle where you will proceed as in the Orrey. To get to the hole you will need to jump up the middle column and turn to the right as you face the boss.

## Kill vex on the moon (Decryption Core repaired)

Once you have completed the above, the next step will take you to the moon where you have to kill vex to collect 120 Decryption Cores, the easiest way to get through this is in the Vex Offensive.

## Lectern Of Enchantment (Core empowered)

Once you have collected the Decryption Cores, head to the Lectern Of Enchantment and charge the item you got from the last step with Phantasmal Fragments. You will need 30 of them. If you don’t have enough, you can farm them in Sorrow Harbor’s or buy them with Helium Filaments.

## The Garden Of Salvation Raid (Complete the quest)

You will now need to go into the Raid to complete the puzzles in it, you need to complete all of them in one sitting and the last one is at the end of the raid so basically, you need to complete the raid in one go.

I won’t go into these steps as I don’t want to ruin the raid experience for anyone that would want to explore it for themselves with no help. If you want to do this the easy way, I’d say check out [KackisHD’s full Raid Guide](https://youtu.be/froVY9nlLCc).
