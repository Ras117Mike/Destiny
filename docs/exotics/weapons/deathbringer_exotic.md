"Sing them a lullaby of death and nothing more."<p>Full Lore on [Ishar Collective](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/deathbringer)|![Deathbringer](/images/icons/deathbringer.jpg)

As with any exotic in Destiny they aide in your leveling so we'd advise to hold off on doing this quest until you hit Light level 900 to help with that last leg of leveling.

## Basic Information
* Type: Rocket Launcher
* Perks:
    * **Dark Deliverance** – _hold left click to fire, and release to detonate rockets that release void orbs._
    * **Dark Descent** - _The higher the orbs fall, the more damage they’ll deal._

## Lore
**Sing them a lullaby of death and nothing more.**

> The Song is the antithesis. The Song is destruction. The failure to master the harmonies of life has birthed the anti-creation – the sullen frequencies of ruin. Those sweet melodies carry with them more than death – a rending of spirit and mind, flaying of the physical self till nothing remains.

>The beauty of the cascading notes. The imperfect inflection of their tune... There has ever been, and will ever be, art in creation. So too in the act of annihilation – erasure and bittersweet finality. This is The Song’s truest gift.

>In its wake, once the echoes have rung their last, there is only silence and the grand splendor for nothingness.

>"Thus is the Song an end, and those who join its Choir are death, and nothing more."
- Unknown

>It is the whispers that corrupt - the hushed temptations that call from the depths of the morrow. How then to quiet their calling? They hunger for Light, beg for it suffering. It may seem counter to the nature of your being, but I offer a solution...

>Give the whispers what they desire.

>Force-feed the murmuring shadows until they are fit to burst with illumination.

Once you've completed the Shadowkeep Campaign you will get a quest from Eris named Luna's Calling which will depend on a weekly memory bounties which you can pick up from Eris after completing the previous one.

## Memory of Sai Mota

This step reads:
> Complete the “Lunar Spelunker” bounty to earn a Firewall Data Fragment. Use the fragment to access the system core vault in the K1 Revelation Lost Sector.

Purchase Eris Morn’s weekly bounty, Lunar Spelunker.

## Lunar Spelunking

For this step you will need to complete 3 Lost Sectors on the moon as follows:

* K1 Communion in the Anchor of Light
* K1 Crew Quarters in the Hellmouth
* K1 Logistics in Archer's Line

Complete all three Sectors, ensure you actually open the chest or it will not count as completed.

Turning in this bounty will grant you a **Firewall Data Fragment** and the next step in the **Memory of Sai Mota** Quest.

### Memory of Sai Mota
#### System core vault accessed

You will now need to complete the `K1 Revelation Lost Sector` in `Sorrows Harbor`. Run through and kill everything in your way :grin: . Once you kill the boss and open the chest, with your back toward the way you made it to the boss area, turn to the right and you will see a tunnel with gold lighting. Head in that tunnel, open the door and interact with the terminal. There will be a Jade Rabbit in the back of the room with the terminal in case you have a cake.

Once you interact with the terminal you will get two new bounties:

* Cleansed Essence of Jealousy
* Memory of Sai Mota

#### Sai Mota’s Broken Necklace

This step reads:
> Search for scraps of Sai Mota’s necklace by defeating Nightmares on the Moon with Arc abilities. Stronger enemies grant more progress.

Sorrow’s Harbor is the best location to do this as there are always Nightmares spawning there, or you can hit Lost Sectors and Nightmare Hunts.

#### Sai Mota’s Repaired Necklace
>Use the portal in Sanctuary to return Sai Mota’s Repaired Necklace to Eris.

Once you've completed gathering fragments, head to Sanctuary and enter the taken portal, present her with the Necklace to claim your prize from the chest next to Eris and get some bits of lore, select "Hear More" to get more lore.

### Symphony of Death

This step reads:

This quest is the reward you get from the chest, it will kick off with the next step.

#### Faculties of the Skull

This step reads:
>Eris Morn believes the Hive’s wicked science can be turned against them. Help her investigate the Circle of Bones beneath the Moon.

Make your way to Circle of Bones in the Hellmouth, locate the Blue banner to launch the next step. Head into the Summoning Pits and stop the Hive’s Wicked Communion. This will drop launch the next step, Tainted Lullaby.

#### Tainted Lullaby

This step reads:
>Your understanding of the Hive’s Deathsong has only just begun. Take the Silent Skull to Eris Morn.

Head to Sanctuary and speak with Eris, she will give you the next step.

#### Marrow’s Elegy

This step reads:
>Collect bones from public events near the Hellmouth, the Lost Sector K1 Revelation in Sorrow’s Harbor, and a wandering Bone Collector on the Moon.

This step instructs you to Collect bones from public events near the Hellmouth, the Lost Sector K1 Revelation in Sorrow’s Harbor, and a wandering Bone Collector on the Moon. Here's how to complete this step:

* **Festering Bone**: Wait around in the Hellmouth for a Public Event to spawn, complete it and open the chest.
* **Ritualistic Bone**: Go to the Lost Sector in Sorrow’s Harbor, defeat the boss and open the chest.
* **Bone Collector**: The Bone Collector is a random spawn but I got mine in Anchor of Light. Spawn in the Sanctuary and head to Anchor of Light, as you enter the area, hang a left, the Bone Collector usually spawns in this area a lot. Kill it and get your bone.

#### Thy Honored Conductor

This step reads:
>Enter the Scarlet Keep strike and slay the High Conductor, Sulmakta, within.

You will need to launch the Scarlet Keep strike on the moon and kill the `High Conductor, Sulmakta` before you kill the boss. I have heard of some people experiencing issues with her spawning, she should be in the same room as the boss when she does.

#### Of Darkest Harmony

This step reads:
>Record your enemies’ screams. Defeat base combatants to record discomfort. Defeat elites and minibosses to record pain. Defeat bosses and other Guardians to record anguish. Screams gathered on the Moon count more.

I did this step doing Public Events on the Moon then sticking around to do the Vex Invasions.
