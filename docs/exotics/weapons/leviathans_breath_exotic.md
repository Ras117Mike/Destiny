## The Back Way
> “Banshee-44 wants to give you a weapon stored in his workshop, but he didn’t specify how to get in. Locate the hidden entrance to Banshee’s workshop and find the weapon.”

## Where Are the Keys, Sir
> “You found a Bow in a display case in a room that’s got to be Banshee’s workshop. Problem is, the case is locked. Return to Banshee to complain. (Politely, of course.)”

Return to Banshee to get the next step in your quest. I just used the spawn point instead of going back through the path.

## Intro to Safecracking 101
> “You need a rotating keycode to access the Bow in Banshee’s workshop, but the original has been lost. You’ll have to generate a new code following the same steps that Banshee did. First on Banshee’s list is to get out into the field to seed a key generator with combat data. Seed data for a new keycode by completing Gambit matches or Vanguard strikes. Gambit Prime matches and Nightfall strikes grant the most efficient progress.”

For this step I did 2 Nightfalls.

## Advanced Safecracking 201
> “The key generator is seeded with viable combat data, and it can now output keycodes… but to constrain the possible set of generated codes, Ghost says you’ll need to provide the generator with some more targeted data. Literally. Use a Bow to land precision final blows against Vex or Cabal.”

This step requires you to get headshots with a box on Cabal or Vex. I completed this step quickly on the Leviathan. Load up the Raid up and head to the Castellum, Cabal come in waves once you've found the point that the Standards will be taken to, simply walk on the plate to start the process.

## Economics of War
> “The key generator needs just a little more data before you’re ready to return to Banshee for final authentication. To further limit the possible codes the generator can create, you’ll have to recreate the conditions under which Banshee programmed the first codes: fighting Red Legion forces during the Red War. Complete an epic reprise of strike “The Arms Dealer” in the European Dead Zone on Earth.”

At this point you need to complete a modified version of The Arms Dealer Strike on the EDZ. You will only have to do the Boss section.

Here a few things to note for this step:
* Don't stand in the same place for too long as there are bombs that fall from the sky and will kill you. Red markers will show to warn you.
* Keep an eye for Zahn's sniper, it melts rather hard.
* Ensure you are killing enemies as they can get overwhelming.

The machanics remain similar as the normal strike. Get Zahn's health down and toward the end of each bar, he will spawn his bubble sheild and call for backup. Pickup the orb and take it to the vent to move forward. Rinse and repeat until you complete the strike.

## Complete the quest
That's it, you are done with actual work. Head back to the Tower and speak to Banshee who will progress you, now head back into his workshop and open the safe to get the Bow. Use the video up top if you need a refresher to get back in.
