# Xenophage Exotic Quest
**This might sting a little.**

-----|-------
I knew it. Knew I'd be back one day—only this time, I was something else. Something… not Human. Not by choice, of course. Those damn Hive. They weren't just tryin' to kill me. They were using me to get to my Light. To drain it from my soul. For their sick experiments.</br>—Omar Agah<p>Full Lore on [Ishtar Collective](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/xenophage)|![Xenophage Icon](/images/icons/xenophage.jpg)

## Emergence
Icon | Description
-----|------------
![Xenophage](/images/icons/emergence.jpg) | _Around you… darkness. If you are to discover your path, you must anchor yourself to light._<p>"It was hard to see the point of a single fireteam taking on Crota, but it was easy to understand how retribution had driven us there. The names of everyone we'd lost in that needless disaster were etched across the walls of the Last City, each and every one a reminder that they were gone and we were not. So when Eriana-3 came knocking, it was a simple decision. From top to bottom, we'd avenge every one of those names. A fire burned in all six of us. We were gonna make sure Crota knew it."<br>—A loyal friend


* Emerged from the dark: 1

To start this quest off you will need to head to the Enduring Abyss, it's the place where you meet Eris after you've finished a memory Pursuit. Sometimes there may be a portal at the Moon spawn point if someone has a quest step to head to Eris at the Abyss. You can also get to it as follows:

* Spawn into Sorrow's Harbour
* Head into the Scarlet Keep and follow the path you did when you first got to fight Crota
* At the first lamp, look to the Right, there is a pathway on the cave wall that will take you to the place you meet Eris but she will not be there

* With your back toward the Pyramid ship, interact with the statues as follows:
    * Bottom Left
    * Top Left
    * Bottom Right
    * Top Right

The second part of this step involves lighting Lecterns in Anchor of Light on the Moon. Head over to anchor of light and proceed to get the light then light the Lecterns and emerge from the Dark.

![Xenophage](/images/icons/pathfinder.jpg) | _A light shines on your path. But you have yet to bring it into focus. Until then, your path remains among the lost._<p>"For me, there was no return from Crota. I lacked hope. Made me not the easiest to get along with. I knew that. But it didn't matter to Eris. She saw hope in me where I wouldn't. Wanted to say thanks, so I tried to gift her a trinket, but she rejected it. Eris wasn't looking for gratitude; she truly saw hope in us all. On our own, we were nothing. But as she'd always remind us, lost as we might be, true strength came from our union.<p>Eris's words rang in my ears as the Hive tore my Light from my soul."<br>—A loyal friend

## Descent
Icon | Description
-----|------------
![Xenophage](/images/icons/descent.jpg) | _Your path brightens, shining through the barrier of emerald, beneath a harbor built from sorrow._<p>"The worst part about what the Hive did to us wasn't the killing. It was the separation. Splitting us up made us weak. They dragged me deep below the lunar surface, through a wall of endless doors. Strung me up. Made my Ghost, Karsys, watch as they tore my Light away, like stripping muscle from bone. Then they killed Karsys in front of me. Sure would've been nice then to have had some of that hope Eris had been peddling."<br>—A loyal friend

* Path uncovered: 1

To complete this step you will need to complete the first phase of the Pit of Heresy dungeon. This involves killing three bosses. To complete this phase you can [follow our guide here](/../../eris_morn/quests/pit_of_heresy_dungeon/#phase-one-necropolis)

After you finish the Necropolis make your way down, when you get to the big crimson wall with lots of doors, look up and to the left; the door you will need to go in will be to third second door to the left with no marking on it.

Make your way to the door then enter the room, there will be a scannable item in the back left that you will need to pick up to be able to finish the next step.

## Discovery
Icon | Description
-----|------------
![Xenophage](/images/icons/discovery.jpg) | _The Pariahs stand guard over far more than just despair, for within these tunnels lie many secrets._<p>"I did see one familiar face before the end. I'm not sure how she found me—probably followed the Hive's trail of runes or something.<p>"The resilience of Eris Morn—her greatest strength and her greatest weakness. To see the Heart of Crota peel my Light away and feed it to those disgusting little maggots and yet do nothing to stop it… She made the right call. 'Else the fire in us both might've gone out that day. I'd never blame her."<br>—A loyal friend

* Path's end located: 1

To complete this step you will need to complete the second phase of the Pit of Heresy dungeon. This involves finding the hidden fire and lighting the door way to open the path to Volmâr. To complete this phase you can [follow our guide here](/../../eris_morn/quests/pit_of_heresy_dungeon/#phase-two-tunnels-of-despair)


## Slay Volmâr, the Tempted

-----|------------
![Xenophage](/images/icons/slay_volmar.jpg) | _The end of your path is in sight. Defeat those who would keep you from it._<p>"Eris did something truly kind for me, however, in those final moments. When she found me strung up, I saw her clutching the trinket I had made her—the one she'd rejected—tightly against her chest. I never forgot that. She'd made sure in that moment that the fire in my heart didn't go out. Made sure I knew I wasn't alone. The fire in me raged. What I would've given to stand with my fireteam one last time and burn those heathens to oblivion!"<br>—A loyal friend


* Volmâr, the Tempted slain: 1

This section is a bit tricky and there are some interesting mechanics involved. Each person in the fireteam will get one of the following elemental buffs:

* Fiery

## Finality

![Xenophage](/images/icons/slay_volmar.jpg) | _Return to Eris Morn with the Hive bug._<p>"As they peeled away my Light piece by piece, the dark began to set in. I went limp. My mind started to fade. But the fire raged on.<p>"It's a funny thing, dying for good twice. I imagine my first death was frightening. But this one was calming. This time I knew I wasn't really gone forever. Neither were my friends. Vell. Eriana. Sai. Toland. …Eris. There was peace in that. Knowing we'd always be together, somewhere. Somehow.<p>"I felt my spirit leave my body through my Light. And then—only darkness."<br>—A loyal friend

* Eris Morn visited: 1

Visit Eris Morn, she will give you the Xenophage.
