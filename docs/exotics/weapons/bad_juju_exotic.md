## Unlock the Tribute Hall
To initiate the quest you will need an Invitation from the Emperor. To get this, visit Werner-44 on the Barge on Nessus and open the chest next to him, it will cost you 5000 glimmer however.

Spawn to the Watcher's Grave area and the barge will be directly in front of you. _p.s. the Xur (IX) logo will not always be on the map as he moves around the world but that is the location of the barge._

### Invitation from the Emperor
After you open the chest, you will get the Invitation from the Emperor step. To complete this step you will need to visit the Tribute Hall and speak to the Visage of Calus. To get to the Tribute Hall, bring up Nessus from the Destinations map and at the bottom you will see the icon next to the Leviathan and Menagerie icons.

Once inside, interact with the Visage and acquire, complete and turn in a daily bounty which grants you a Boon of Opulence and unlocks the Hall. Return to the Hall

### Complete Champion Bounties and Unlock Tributes
To progress the quest you will need to complete bounties and unlock statues.

* Bounties will grant you Boon of Opulence which will reduce the cost of items in the hall by 1% up to a total of 80%.
* Tributes grant you statutes that you use to place around the hall to unlock different features of the hall, they range from Orbs of Light, to Ammo to Holograms of enemies to target practice with.

## Tributes
* You will need to complete 18 Tributes to unlock the Bad Juju Quest itself.
* To gain Tributes you can buy tributes from the Visage. These cost lots of materials so getting those Boons will be important for this process. Spider rotates materials for sale so check him out if you are in need.
* The other way is to complete Triumphs but you will need to have Calus themed gear and weapons to progress these. Items with a Chalice logo in the icon will work (Season of Opulence rewards you get from Menagerie). The more pieces you have on the better, exotics are even better for progress.

To check what you need to complete, open the Triumphs tab on your menu and click the Destination Tab. Open Tribute Hall Triumphs, each of these will grant you a Tribute Statue.
