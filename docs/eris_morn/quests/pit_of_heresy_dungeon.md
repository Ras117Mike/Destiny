We created a wake when we destroyed Hashladûn and took the Cryptoglyph-and that wake has grown and grown. Hashladûn's two remaining sisters appear to have picked up where her foul plans left off. Once again, strange Hive rituals have commenced near her Keep. We must tame these plans before they become too grand to handle."

## A. Travel to Sorrow's Harbor on the Moon and investigate the Hive rituals happening there.

## B. Return to Eris Morn in Sanctuary and report your findings on the Altars of Sorrow.
