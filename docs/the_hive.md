encounter# The Hive
!!! quote
    "The Fundament is very large. We are the smallest things in it. If you don’t understand something, it will probably kill you. My teacher Taox says this is why we have such short lives. So we can breed and adapt quickly."<br>— Xi Ro

The Hive are a species from the planet Fundament ruled by the Osmiun King. The original class were proto-Hive called krill, they had a short life-span. The king would be assassinated by the Helium Drinkers at the behest of Taox, who tutored the kings three daughters Xi Ro, Sathona, and Aurash. Aurash was the only one that he confided his fears. His daughters fled and vowed to return to claim vengence for their father. After finding a Shvubi Maelstrom ship, and taking it to the depths of Fundamet's Ocean at the behest of Sathona, they encountered the worms and made a pact with them.

The Three Sisters by <a href="http://conceptartworld.com/artists/piotr-jablonski/">Piotr Jabłoński</a> on conceptartworld.com

While in the deep, they discovered that the Syzygy was real and had struck the planet. Their they encountered the mythical Leviathan who warned them to turn back but they kept going to the center of Fundament where they encountered the Worm Gods Akka, the Worm of Secrets, Eir, the Keeper of Order, Ur, the Ever-Hunger, Xol, Will of the Thousands, and Yul, the Honest Worm.

It is here that the three sisters became the first Hive: Xi Ro took the Knight morph and became Xivu Arath, Sathona took the Mother morph and became Savathûn, and Aurash took the King morph, transforming into a male and became Auryx, the King of the Hive.

## Royal Family Tree

## Osmium King
No known image of the king is available. King of the Osmium Court and father of all the hive humanity has known. He kept a dead white worm that washed up on the shore. It is said that the worm guided the King, in his old age he became senile and obsessed over Fundaments Moon aligning and causing a Syzygy that would create a tidal wave so immense that it would destroy all of Fundaments civilizations.

## Oryx
> "I am Aurash, first daughter of the dead king. I will chase my father’s last screamed warning. I will know what changed the motion of our moons. If the end of the world is coming, I will understand why. On my center eye I swear it. I will understand."<br>— Aurash

After their pact with the worms, Aurash, eldest daughter to the Osmium King, was renamed Auryx, he is the heir to the Osmium Throne, he is the Taken King, founding father of the Hive and Father to Crota and Nokris. He reigned alongside his Sisters Savathûn, the Witch-Queen and Xivu Arath, God of War. After they drove Taox out of theOsmium court, the three forced their people to partake of the worms, thus becoming Hive or perish. Once they transformed the people into Hive and built their ships, they focussed their attention on the Ammonites that provided Toax asylum. Auryx was willing to negotiate with them but Savathûn would not have it and killed Auryx, his should however passed into his Ascendent throne world. They devised the Sword Logic and warred with each other in hopes of becoming the sharpest blades in the universe. Retreating to their Ascendent real each time they died.

After discovering that they were decieved by the worms, Auryx consulted with his sisters in his Ascendent realm, after offering their power to him, Auryx killed both his sisters and used their powers to confront and kill his patron worm Akka so that he would steal it's ability to call on the deep, Auryx then created the Tablets of Ruin which gave him the power to Take. It is at this point tha Auryx became Oryx, The Taken King. During a later war, he revived his sisters and devised the Tithing system where each Hive would kill enemies and take their essence, use some to feed their worm and tithe the rest up the chain, each step tithing up until reaching Oryx, Savathûn and Xivu Arath.

The sisters eventually conspired to cut Oryx off his tributes by marooning him in his Ascendent realm. Oryx ends up killing his sisters again and spawning his spawns Crota, Nokris, the Deathsinger twins Ir Anûk and Ir Halak.

After the defeat of Crota, Oryx made his way to the Sol system and in the rings of Saturn waged war with the Awoken. You are sent out to investigate a Cabal distress signal only to find that the Taken wad started to wage what would become known as the Taken War. You go on a series of missions to defeat Taken warriors all over the system, making your way to the Court of Oryx defeating his minions you make your way deeper into the Dreadnaught you first defeat Oryx in the Sanctum but he retreats into his Ascendent realm. You fight your way through Oryx's closest allies the Warpriest and Golgorath and killing his Deathsinger Twins you defeat Oryx using his own captured light against him.

### Crota

Son of Oryx and Hive Prince, he is father to 4 daughters, the eldest, Hashladûn was fathered with Omnigul. Tasked with the destruction of Earth and the Traveler. Crota was raised by Oryx to be his Eater of Hope. On his path to the Sol system, he travelled to distant worlds consuming them for his father.

Tricked by his aunt Savathûn, he cut opened a portal into his ascendent real and let the Vex in. The vex would create the Quria, Blade Transform to deduce the Hive's Sword Logic. Proving hard to rid, Oryx threw Crota through the portal telling him to _"Come home glorious, or die forgotten!"_

He eventually conquered the moon they launched an attack on the city called the Battle of Burning Lake. Humanity launched a counterattack on the moon, not knowing the threat looming there. Many Guardians perished at Crotas sword, this battle would come to be known as The Great Disaster.

Crota would ultimately meet his end at the hands of your fireteam as you ascended into the Hellmouth into the Oversoul Throne room and turned Crota's Sword Logic against him, killing him with the Cleavers of his fallen Blades.

Crota's soul would be essential in the quest to defeat Oryx.

Crota

#### Hashladûn
Eldest daughter of Crota, fathered with Omnigul. She built the Scarlet Keep over the Pyramid Ship to harness it's powers and sits at the top of the Tower of Woes, luring Guardians to be killed as revenge for her family.

She is ultimately killed by you and your fireteam. She was born a larger Thrall than the normal and was forced into a ritual called the Floods.  Hashladûn fought off the initial crew that came for her but was ultimately taken to the Ascendent Plane by Crota himself where she was impaled and flooded 5 times. After the 5th flooding, she escaped and crawled back into Crota's throne world where he utters:

> “You are great now, and you cannot love Me. For the parts of you that were Mine have been taken from you; the parts that were His remain.”

Hashladûn was sworn into Oryx's court. Guardians presumed she was dead after the raid on Crota but she reamined hidded under the Moon's surface where she and her sisters plotted revenge. Together they gathered the hive on the moon and started constructing the Scarlet Keep where they conducted experiments beneath the citadel using the Crptoglyph. The sisters devised a plan to recreate Oryx as a phantasmal Nightmare, despite knowing that they would violate the sword logic.

As you were working with Eris to enter the Pyramid Ship beneath the Keep, you and your fireteam encounter Hashladûn at the bridge of the Keep and chase her through the Keep until you get to the top of the Spire. Despite her powers, like her other family members, she falls at your hands and in her remains you find evidence of the Crptoglyph hidden in the depths of the Hellmouth.

### Nokris
Estranged second son of Oryx, he was exiled for his Heresy when he communed with the Worm God Xol. Nokris traded hi heart fo some of Xol's power and the secret of necromancy as the practice of necromancy was a direct violation of the Sword Logic. Oryx had all references of Nokris removed from the World's Grave and the Book of Sorrow; only a statue on the Dreadnaught near the Altar of Oryx remained.

Nokris promised Xol he would conquer Mars in his name and they both headed to Mars, the Warmind Rasputin resisted them and trapped them within the ice of Hellass Basin where they remained trapped until the end of the Red war when the ice began to melt as a result of the Traveller's awakening. Ana Bray sent out a distress beacon to which you answered.

Using a shard of the Traveler, you lure Xol out to destroy him, Nokris attempted to stop you but was incinerated thus failing to stop you from killing Xol.
