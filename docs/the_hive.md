# The Hive
!!! quote
    "The Fundament is very large. We are the smallest things in it. If you don’t understand something, it will probably kill you. My teacher Taox says this is why we have such short lives. So we can breed and adapt quickly."<br>— Xi Ro

The Hive are a species from the planet Fundament ruled by the Osmiun King. The original class were proto-Hive called krill, they had a short life-span. The king would be assassinated by the Helium Drinkers at the behest of Taox, who tutored the kings three daughters Xi Ro, Sathona, and Aurash. Aurash was the only one that he confided his fears. His daughters fled and vowed to return to claim vengence for their father. After finding a Shvubi Maelstrom ship, and taking it to the depths of Fundamet's Ocean at the behest of Sathona, they encountered the worms and made a pact with them.

While in the deep, they discovered that the Syzygy was real and had struck the planet. Their they encountered the mythical Leviathan who warned them to turn back but they kept going to the center of Fundament where they encountered the Worm Gods Akka, the Worm of Secrets, Eir, the Keeper of Order, Ur, the Ever-Hunger, Xol, Will of the Thousands, and Yul, the Honest Worm.

It is here that the three sisters became the first Hive: Xi Ro took the Knight morph and became Xivu Arath, Sathona took the Mother morph and became Savathûn, and Aurash took the King morph, transforming into a male and became Auryx, the King of the Hive.
