## Personnel Data

Ada-1 was born as Adelaide Meyrin during the Golden Age and was the daughter of Henriette Meyrin, one of the three founding leaders of the Black Armory. During the Collapse, she was fatally injured by a minion of the Darkness, forcing her mother to save her life by implanting her consciousness into an experimental Exo frame, becoming Ada-1.

At first glance, Ada-1 is secretive, distrusting and contemptuous, mostly towards the Guardians due to the hardship she had faced years prior at the hands of a rogue Risen. This has left her rather unwilling to associate herself and her Armory with the Guardian in any way, regardless of their reputation as heroes to the Last City and the countless foes they have defeated that have threatened the Solar System.

Ada-1 takes great pride in her order, the Black Armory, finding that her wares surpass all others, and no one should even try to counterfeit Black Armory weapons. As a result, she is very confident that those who buy her wares will be more than satisfied.

## Location
Ada is located in the Tower, in the Annex area. Use the span point there to launch into the Tower, head up the stairs and a short bit past the Drifter; as you get to the square area with the stairs, head left and you will see the entrance to Ada-1's Armory. You can also place a waypoint on her icon to have a marker as you move around the tower.
