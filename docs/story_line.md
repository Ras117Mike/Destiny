## The Red War

* Homecoming - The Last City is under attack by the Red Legion. It's time to fight back.
* Adieu - The Red Legion has overrun the Last City. The Light is gone. You are powerless. Live to fight another day.
* Spark - While Hawthorne offers shelter to those who fled the City, a vision points to a long-forgotten place.
* Devrim Kay - The Fallen are all over (and under) the EDZ. Return to Devrim for now, and start helping Hawthorne.
* Combustion - Hawthorne's waiting on the cliffs above the salt mines. Help her get the word out: we rally at the Farm.
* Hope - Commander Zavala is building a resistance at a moon of Saturn. Make contact and join the fight.
* Riptide - Without power, Zavala's resistance has hit a wall. Travel deeper into the Arcology and help them past it.
* Utopia - Venture deep into the heart of the Hive to retrieve a powerful Golden Age CPU—and make it out alive.
* Looped - No one's heard from Cayde-6 since the Hunter took off for an uncharted world. Track him down.
* Six - A crashed colony ship, an interspecies war... Cayde-6 got that adventure he wanted. Go save him from it.
* Sacrilege - Since the loss of her Light, Ikora has many questions—and she's not leaving Io without answers.
* Fury - Help Ikora use the Warmind on Io to learn more about the Almighty—and turn the tide of the war.
* Payback - Time for Zavala's grand entrance—finally attacking the Red Legion base in the EDZ head-on.
* Unbroken - Find Thumos the Unbroken and take the key codes he carries—by any means necessary.
* Larceny - Break into the Red Legion base and steal the personal shuttle of Thumos the no-longer-Unbroken.
* 1AU - The time has come to stop the Almighty. Board the ship, and shut down its annihilation weapon.
* Chosen - The Almighty is finished. Time to go home, save the Traveler, take back the City, and end this war. Be brave.
* Raid: Leviathan

## Curse of Osiris

* The Gateway - Osiris's damaged Ghost appeared on Mercury---along with a Vex army. That can't be a coincidence.
* A Deadly Trial - Brother Vance says there's a Temple of Osiris in the EDZ where you can revive Sagira.

* Tree of Probabilities - Now you know where to find the map of the Infinite Forest. Go and get it.
* Hijacked - You need a Vex Mind to help you read the map of the Infinite Forest. Head to Nessus to find one.
* A Garden World - Enter the Infinite Forest and steal the algorithm that will let you track Panoptes in the present.
