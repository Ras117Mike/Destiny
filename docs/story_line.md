* **The Invitation** - Emperor Calus has invited you to Nessus, but you think it wise to drop in with Ikora before you go.
* **The Invitation** - Ikora's intelligence indicates that a Cabal barge has just landed on the surface of Nessus. That lines up with Calus's promise that he sent a "gift" to Nessus for you. Locate the barge on Nessus.

* **The Invitation** - Return to Werner 99-40 on the Imperial Barge on Nessus.
* **The Invitation** - Calus has invited you to enter his Menagerie on the Leviathan. There, he promises you'll be able to unleash the true potential of your Chalice of Opulence.

* **Ghosts of Our Past** - Eris used a Hive talisman of her own to create the first piece of protective armor. To pass beyond the Pyramid's warding and discover what lies within, you'll need to wear a full set of Dreambane armor. Take the first step and hunt the Nightmare of Omnigul.

* **In the Deep** - Somewhere in the horrific depths of the Hellmouth lies the Hive Cryptoglyph. With it, Eris Morn can craft further Dreambane armor for your quest to find a way inside the Pyramid. The Cryptoglyph is yours to take from the Hive… if you can.
* **Back from the Dark** - Taking the Cryptoglyph from the Catacombs has interrupted the dark rituals planned by the Hidden Swarm… for now. With the Cryptoglyph and Eris's magic, you should be able to craft further Dreambane armor. Return to Eris Morn with the Cryptoglyph.
* **Lectern of Enchantment** - Use the Cryptoglyph to empower the Lectern of Enchantment near Eris Morn.

## Season of Dawn

* **Speak with Ikora Rey** - Speak with Ikora Rey in the Tower Bazaar.

* **Recovery Operation** - The structure of the obelisk must be repaired so it can be linked to the Sundial. Osiris believes some members of the Red Legion fled Mercury with tech pilfered from the Sundial. If you recover the components, you may be able to forge a link. Defeat Cabal on the Tangled Shore to recover Sundial Components. Cabal defeated with Solar weapons and abilities may drop additional materials.
* **Reinforcements** - You've recovered the materials that will help connect the obelisk to the Sundial. Now, you must bring these back to the obelisk in order to modify it. Bank the recovered Sundial Components at the obelisk.
* **Light Collection** - Now that you've modified the obelisk with tech from the Sundial, there is only one more component needed: your Light. The obelisk is not yet active, but using your Light to charge it will allow you to bring it back to full power. Charge the obelisk by defeating enemies with abilities and your Super, and by collecting Orbs of Light.
* **Light Infusion** - You have gathered a powerful Light charge, which you can transfer to the obelisk. Once you charge the obelisk with this Light, you will restore it to its full power. Bank the Light charge you accumulated to power the obelisk.
* **Timeline Stabilization** - You've restored the obelisk and charged it with your Light. You must finalize its activation to attune it to the temporal disturbance stemming from Mercury. Interact with the obelisk to complete its activation.
* **A Missing Link** - The obelisk is fully functioning. All that's left is to link it to the Sundial by strengthening its power here on the Shore. Activate the Tangled Shore Obelisk's Sundial link.
* **Visit Osiris** - Now that the link between the obelisk and the Sundial is established, Osiris needs your help within the Sundial itself. Return to Osiris at the Sundial Spire on Mercury.
* **The Sundial** - Osiris has asked you to enter the Sundial so that he might calibrate it to you, allowing you to move across Mercury's past and future to defeat the Cabal. Enter the Sundial Arena playlist.
* **Detached from Time** - As you left the Sundial, you found a strange object that seemed to materialize from nowhere. The object is unidentifiable, but seems to be phasing between timelines, flickering in your hands. You think Osiris may be able to help you determine its origin. Bring the phased object to Osiris at the Sundial Spire.
