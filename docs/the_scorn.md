# The Scorn

The Scorn are a horde of undead Fallen led by Fikrul, the Fanatic and Uldren Sov. They orchestrated a massive breakout from the Prison of Elders and murdered Cayde-6 in the process, and have since spread throughout much of the Reef and the Dreaming City.

## The Scorn  Structure

* **Abomination** - large, monstrous Scorn creatures that have been transformed into ferocious beasts by repeated reanimation.
* **Chieftain** - the commanding Scorn unit
* **Lurker** - a shield-bearing Scorn unit that uses a gladiatorial shield to block incoming damage for themselves and their allies.
* **Raider** - a trooper-type of Scorn unit armed with a Scorn Rifle which fires Void sawblades, and are capable of maneuvering through the battlefield with the use of a smoke-dash ability.
* **Ravager** - a class of melee-focused Scorn that wield fiery censers as weapons.
* **Scorn Walker** - a powerful, modified variant of the Fallen Walker.
* **Screeb** - arachnid-like Scorn units which travel in packs and charge at attackers, dealing massive damage through self-detonation.
* **Stalker** - reanimated Dregs allied with the Scorn they wield Fallen Maces.
* **Wraith** - a class of large, melee-focused Scorn that wield Flame Torches in battle.
