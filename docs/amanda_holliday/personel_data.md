## Personnel Data
Amanda Holliday is a human shipwright and pilot found in the Tower's hangar. She repairs Guardians' personal spaceships, as well as sells new ships and Sparrows. Amanda is also involved in organizing the Sparrow Racing League and works closely with the SRL pilots to upgrade their Sparrows and experiment with new designs.

Amanda was born on the road to a refugee family traveling towards the Last City. Her people were scavengers, and her childhood was spent fixing up vehicles that helped her family survive. Her mother Nora carried a weapon named The Chaperone, a finely decorated shotgun that she used to protect the refugee group.

While traveling with another family who had a young daughter named Lucia, the band was forced to take shelter in a crashed dropship in a forest due to bad weather. Amanda was shown by Lucia how to work with the electronic components they scavenged form the dropship which they used to create small lights all around the ship.

Amanda's mother died while defending her family on the road as they were crossing the Panama Ravine. She and her father buried Nora with the Chaperone before carrying on their journey towards the Last City. Sadly, when they were only a half-day's walk away from the gates of the City, Amanda's father also perished, leaving her the only survivor of her family and refugee group to reach the last safe haven for humanity under the Traveler.

Amanda was critical in the Taken war as she outfitted Eris Morn's ship with stealth technology, at the behest of Cayde-6 for his plan to use in for an unsanctioned mission to board the Dreadnaught. Amanda worked with Tex Mechanica to recreate her mother's shotgun, the Chaperone, and award a copy of it to the winner of a Crucible contest. She created an exact replica of the weapon her mother used, down to it tracery, although it was far more powerful due to Tex Mechanica's engineering. She also helped bring the Sparrow Racing League to the mainstream, acting as host for the races, and assisting Guardians in obtaining Licenses

Amanda is typically very jovial and sarcastic. She gets along well with Cayde-6, as both are willing to bend or break the Vanguard's rules to get tasks done. While on Titan, Amanda's personality seems to undergo a slight change as she appears somewhat subdued and even reluctant to take part in missions. This may be due to shock at having lost the City, and having seen so many Lightless Guardians fall. She recovers following the reclamation of the Last City from the Red Legion.
