## The Cabal Structure

* **Centurion** - tactical field commanders and are highly skilled in the use of the munitions fitted on their heavy armor.
* **Colossus** - lead through their own relentless demeanor, wielding devastating Gatling-style Heavy Slug Throwers and Cabal Slug Launchers.
* **Gladiator** - found primarily in the employ of the Red Legion, these fighters fearlessly and relentlessly charge enemy lines; cutting down all who stand before them with their Cabal Serveri.
* **Incendior** - flamethrower troops deployed by the Red Legion to incinerate both infantry and infrastructure. They carry Cabal Magma Launchers, which are fed via twin fuel tanks on their backs.
* **Legionairy** - are the most common troops found in the Cabal army and are primarily armed with Slug Rifles or, in rare cases, Projection Rifles.
* **Phalanx** - similar to Legionnaires and carry big tactical shields that serve as a mobile defensive front; they have no jump-jets.
* **Psion** - a powerful race of clairvoyant, technological manipulating, psionic beings who were conquered and enslaved by the Cabal in the hopes of weaponizing their abilities.
* **Scorpius** - a ballistic war turret that is employed by the Cabal Empire.
* **War Beast** - feral, vicious attack animals deployed by the Red Legion as either shock troops, a distraction or as cannon fodder to protect their other forces.
