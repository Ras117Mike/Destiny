# About
This project started out of the idea for a personal place to keep reference materials I need as I play Destiny. I figured if I'm doing this for me, there may be others that could benefit from it as well; so I decided to put it online.

The plan is for this to be a centralized repository for the Destiny 2 game providing instructions with some lore tied in so you can have one site up with all the information you need as you play.

The goal is not to be a definitive or comprehensive database for all things Destiny or a community platform.

## Why do this?
True, there are already lots of different places that do similar. The issue I have with those resources for the most part is that they are in blog format with no organization and some are poorly written and make you guess what you should be doing. Many of the resources leave you searching and hoping that the site you are on has the information you are looking for or else you find yourself on a Google hunt opening several pages until you find the one that is clear enough to follow.

I read one tutorial that gave this as instruction without telling you where to spawn to get to the barge which is not shown on the map:

>Go to Werner 99-40 on the Nessus barge.

For this project, things will be organized in a more Reference layout with proper grouping and grow into a community project. We aim to organize things by Vendor for the most part with Exotics having their own area so you can get to them quickly.

## External References
There are many excellent external references that can be used, these are the main ones that will be common around the different pages here:
